Embassy Rescue: a Doom map by Swampyrad
=======================================

A map inspired by the NES game Rescue: The Embassy Mission.
The story involves an embassy building being taken over by a 
terrorist group, holding everyone inside hostage. You are flown
in by helicopter and dropped onto the rooftop. You carefully 
lower yourself over the ledge with ropes and break in through 
windows on the top floor. Once inside, you must find 3 keys, one
on each of the 3 floors, in order to override the security system
keeping the main entrance locked and allow the hostages to escape.
Keep an eye out as you navigate the building, as terrorists are
scattered around the many rooms, some hiding in wait to get the
jump on you, so watch your back.

Replaces MAP01 and a few music tracks. 
Includes a custom weapon that replaces the Chaingun with an MP5SD.
Also includes a compatibility patch for Hideous Destructor to
replace the Zombiemen with Undead Homeboys, since the terrorists
are meant to be using pistols.

Enemy spawns are randomized, so no two playthroughs are the same.
The 3 keys always spawn in the same rooms, however.

Difficulty modes change the number of monsters that spawn.
Hey, Not So Rough: 15-20 enemies
Hurt Me Plenty: 20-30 enemies
Ultraviolence: 30-40 enemies

This is my first ever map, and I spent about 2 weeks working on it.
Thanks for playing! :3
